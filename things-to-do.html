    <h1 class="page-title">Things to do in Slovenia</h1>
  <div class="page-body">
    <p></p>
    <p>
      We’re so happy to have many friends and family members join us from all over the world.
      If you’re coming from abroad and wish to explore Slovenia a little bit before or after the wedding,
      this is certainly a great opportunity to do it.
    </p>
    <h2>Tourist must-sees (or at least must-knows)</h2>
    <h3><strong>Lakes Bled and Bohinj</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Lake Bled is one of the most known tourist spots in Slovenia and with good reason. To be honest,
      some people here are even a bit fed up with it - it’s almost too cheesy and there are usually (too)
      many people there. However, I do think it’s worth visiting because it’s super pretty. While you’re there,
      don’t forget to stop at a caf&eacute; and have a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cremeschnitte">krem&scaron;nita</a></em>.
      You simply cannot visit Bled and <em>not</em> have kremšnita while you’re there.
    </p>
    <p>The other - and in my opinion more beautiful - lake nearby is lake Bohinj. Even though there can also be many people here, it still feels a bit less touristy and more natury. Here, you can have a nice walk or swim in the lake or you can do a bunch of other activities like kayaking, supping, hiking, rafting, cycling, etc. For more information, check out this site: <a href="https://www.bohinj.si/en/">https://www.bohinj.si/en/</a></p>
    <p>To combine both lakes for a great chill summer day, we suggest the following: Go to Lake Bohinj in the morning and spend the day by the lake, then head to Bled for dinner (we recommend this restaurant: <a href="https://www.pri-planincu.com/">https://www.pri-planincu.com/</a>) and have kremšnita for dessert.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Postojna Cave and Predjama Castle</h3>
    <p>Another spot you will find on all “things to do in Slovenia” lists is Postojna Cave, often combined with the visit of Predjama Castle.</p>
    <p>Visiting Postojna Cave is a bit pricey but if you’re curious to see it, it’s worth the visit. Check out more about it here: <a href="https://www.postojnska-jama.eu/en/postojna-cave/">https://www.postojnska-jama.eu/en/postojna-cave/</a> (Keep in mind though that it can get quite chilly in the cave so make sure you get an extra sweater or jacket with you. Otherwise, you can also buy or rent one there.)</p>
    <p>Predjama Castle (which we suggest you visit before the cave if you’re going there) is the world’t largest cave castle and has very interesting history - you can learn a bit about the castle itself and about Slovenia, if that’s something interesting to you. Check out more about it here: <a href="https://www.postojnska-jama.eu/en/predjama-castle/">https://www.postojnska-jama.eu/en/predjama-castle/</a></p>
    <h2>For the nature lovers</h2>
    <h3>Triglav national park</h3>
    <p>If the mountains are calling for you, you will enjoy visiting the Triglav national park. (The aforementioned Lake Bohinj is also a part of it, so if you just visit that, you’ll already get the taste of it.) The park has many beautiful mountains, hills, valleys, waterfalls, and other gorgeous spots. There are plenty of things to do within the park and its surrounding towns. You can read more about it here: <a href="https://www.tnp.si/en/visit/">https://www.tnp.si/en/visit/</a></p>
    <p>If you’d like to spend a few days here, you can find accommodation in nearby towns like Kranjska Gora (<a href="https://kranjska-gora.si/en">https://kranjska-gora.si/en</a>) or Bovec (<a href="https://www.soca-valley.com/en/">https://www.soca-valley.com/en/</a>) - both of which are also beautiful and offer plenty of activities (both for the sportsy people and for the more normal ones who prefer to chill and just enjoy nature without having to move every second of the day ;)). </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Notranjski park</h3>
    <p>There is another group of lovely things to see near Postojna, more specifically, near a town called Cerknica and you can learn more about it here: <a href="https://www.notranjski-park.si/en">https://www.notranjski-park.si/en</a> Here, we especially recommend visiting the Rakov Škocjan Valley and Lake Cerknica.</p>
    <p>The Rakov Škocjan Valley is really beautiful and you can enjoy a lovely walk in the shadows of the forest here. Find more info here: <a href="https://www.notranjski-park.si/en/nature/natural-sights/rakov-skocjan-valley">https://www.notranjski-park.si/en/nature/natural-sights/rakov-skocjan-valley</a></p>
    <p>Lake Cerknica is one of the largest intermittent lakes in Europe and you can find out more here: <a href="https://www.notranjski-park.si/en/nature/natural-sights/lake-cerknica">https://www.notranjski-park.si/en/nature/natural-sights/lake-cerknica</a></p>

    <h2>City life</h2>
    <h3>Ljubljana</h3>
    <p>If you’re more of a city tourist, you are going to love Ljubljana. There are also other beautiful towns in Slovenia and I will add more about them later but for now, we’ll stick with the capital.</p>
    <p>The Ljubljana Castle is a great spot to visit and you can go by foot (know that it’s up the hill though) or you can take the funicular. From the Castle, you’ll have a lovely view of Ljubljana and I think it’s definitely worth the visit. If you want to spend some money, you can also visit the tower (to get an even better view hehe) and go within the castle. In the castle, there is also a cool museum of puppetry. Read more info about Ljubljana Castle here: <a href="https://www.ljubljanskigrad.si/en/">https://www.ljubljanskigrad.si/en/</a> </p>
    <p>If you are visiting Ljubljana, an evening stroll along the river Ljubljanica in the center and the old town is a must. You can enjoy a drink or a dinner in one of many cafes and restaurants there. On the stroll, make sure to find Prešeren Square (with the statue of France Prešeren, deemed the greatest Slovenian poet, or at least, the greatest Slovenian poet so far) and the Triple Bridge (Tromostovje) right next to it.</p>
    <p>Another spot to visit is definitely Park Tivoli. It’s Ljubljana’s biggest park, where you can just chill the whole day. You can have a picnic, read under the trees, or enjoy a drink in a cafe.</p>
    <p>There are so many more activities and sights to see in Ljubljana. If you’re interested in museums, galleries, or fun stuff to do, just contact us and we can advise you what to visit and do while you’re there.</p>
    <h2>Just ask us</h2>
    <p>In general, there are a million things to do and see around here and we’d love to help you decide  where to go, what to do, and what to see.</p>
